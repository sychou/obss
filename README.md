# Obss

Obss is a quick hack of an excuse to play with OpenAI's embedding feature.

The CLI is not at all impressive and I should probably spend a bit of time
making it more useful. But the results of the semantic search are pretty
unimpressive so I'm more inclined to see if it could be made better.

## Installation

- Clone this repo
- Set up a venv (optional but recommended)
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Copy `sample-config.toml` to `config.toml` and modify values
